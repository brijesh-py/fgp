Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles. It has applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and more. The primary functions in trigonometry are sine, cosine, and tangent, often abbreviated as sin, cos, and tan, respectively. These functions relate the angles of a right-angled triangle to the ratios of its sides.

1. **Sine (sinθ):** In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.

    - sin(θ)= Opposite side/Hypotenuse
​
3. **Cosine (cosθ):** The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.

   - cos(θ)= Adjacent side/Hypotenuse

5. **Tangent (tanθ):** The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the adjacent side.
   
   - tan(θ)= Opposite side/Adjacent side

These basic trigonometric functions can be extended to cover all real numbers using the unit circle or through the use of trigonometric identities. Trigonometry is widely used to solve problems involving angles and distances, and it plays a crucial role in various branches of science and engineering. Additionally, trigonometric functions have periodic properties, which make them useful in analyzing repetitive phenomena, such as waves and oscillations.

These inverse functions "undo" the effects of the corresponding trigonometric functions. Remember that the output of these inverse functions is an angle, and the result is typically expressed in degrees or radians, depending on the context. The range of these inverse functions is often restricted to specific intervals to make them one-to-one functions. Always check the context or use additional information to determine the appropriate angle.
