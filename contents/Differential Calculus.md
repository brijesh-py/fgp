# Differential Calculus - I

Let's delve a bit deeper into some key concepts and methods in Differential Calculus.

### Higher-Order Derivatives:
The derivative of a function gives the rate at which the function is changing. The second derivative (\(f''(x)\)) represents the rate of change of the first derivative. Higher-order derivatives can be computed similarly.

### Local Extrema and Critical Points:
Critical points occur where the derivative is zero or undefined. To find local extrema, you analyze the sign of the derivative around critical points using the First Derivative Test.

### Concavity and Points of Inflection:
The second derivative test helps determine the concavity of a function. Points where the concavity changes are called inflection points.

### Mean Value Theorem:
If \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b)\), then there exists at least one \(c\) in \((a, b)\) such that \(\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c)\).

### Related Rates:
In related rates problems, you use the chain rule to find the rate at which one quantity changes concerning the rate of change of another related quantity.

### Optimization Problems:
Optimization involves finding the maximum or minimum value of a function. Critical points and endpoints of the domain are typically considered.

### Newton's Method:
An iterative numerical technique to approximate the roots of a real-valued function.

### Rolle's Theorem:
If \(f(x)\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), differentiable on \((a, b)\), and \(f(a) = f(b)\), then there exists at least one \(c\) in \((a, b)\) such that \(f'(c) = 0\).

### Implicit Differentiation:
Used when you have an equation relating \(x\) and \(y\) and you want to find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) implicitly.

### Logarithmic Differentiation:
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of an equation to simplify complex expressions before differentiating.

### Hyperbolic Functions:
Derivatives of hyperbolic functions such as \(\sinh(x)\) and \(\cosh(x)\).

### Linear Approximation and Differentials:
The linear approximation of a function at a point is given by \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\). Differentials (\(dy\) and \(dx\)) can be used for approximations.

These concepts and methods are crucial for understanding the behavior of functions, finding critical points, and optimizing functions. Remember to practice solving problems to solidify your understanding of these topics.

## Functions

Certainly! Let's explore the concept of functions with an example, and I'll try to keep it simple and easy to understand.

### Functions:

A function is like a machine that takes an input, performs a specific operation, and produces an output. The key idea is that each input value corresponds to exactly one output value.

### Example:

Let's consider a simple function:

\[ f(x) = 2x + 3 \]

In this function:
- \( f(x) \) is the output (or dependent variable).
- \( x \) is the input (or independent variable).
- The rule of the function is to multiply the input (\( x \)) by 2 and then add 3.

### Understanding the Function:

1. **Input-Output Relationship:**
   - If we input \( x = 1 \), the function gives us \( f(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \).
   - If we input \( x = 2 \), the function gives us \( f(2) = 2(2) + 3 = 7 \).
   - Similarly, for any \( x \), \( f(x) \) will be \( 2x + 3 \).

3. **Domain and Range:**
   - The domain is all possible values for \( x \), which in this case is any real number.
   - The range is all possible values for \( f(x) \), which is also any real number.

4. **Function Notation:**
   - Instead of saying "the function of \( x \)," we write \( f(x) \) to represent the output.

### Additional Notes:

- Functions can have different forms, and they might involve more complex operations or combinations of variables.
- The goal is to understand the relationship between the input and output and how the function behaves for different values of the input.

In summary, a function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly one output. The example \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \) is a simple linear function, but functions can take many different forms depending on the operations involved.

## limits

Certainly! Let's explore the concept of limits with a simple example to make it easy to understand.

### Limits:

The limit of a function describes the behavior of the function as the input approaches a particular value. It represents the value that the function gets closer and closer to as the input gets arbitrarily close to a specific point.

### Example:

Consider the function:

\[ f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \]

Now, let's investigate the limit of this function as \( x \) approaches 1:

\[ \lim_{{x \to 1}} f(x) \]

### Understanding the Limit:

1. **Direct Substitution:**
   - If you try to substitute \( x = 1 \) directly into the function, you get an indeterminate form (\( \frac{0}{0} \)), which means further analysis is needed.

2. **Simplifying the Function:**
   - Factorizing the numerator, we get \( (x + 1)(x - 1) \). Now, we can cancel out the common factor of \( (x - 1) \) in the numerator and denominator:

   \[ f(x) = \frac{(x + 1)\cancel{(x - 1)}}{\cancel{(x - 1)}} = x + 1 \]

3. **Evaluating the Limit:**
   - Now, if you substitute \( x = 1 \) into the simplified function, you get \( \lim_{{x \to 1}} f(x) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

### Additional Notes:

- In this example, we initially encountered an indeterminate form (\( \frac{0}{0} \)), indicating that further algebraic manipulation was needed to simplify the expression.
- The limit of a function does not necessarily require the function to be defined at the point in question; it's about the behavior as \( x \) approaches that point.

In summary, when dealing with limits, you often need to simplify the expression and evaluate it as the variable approaches a particular value. In this case, the limit of \( \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \) as \( x \) approaches 1 is 2.

## continuity

Continuity is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes the smooth, uninterrupted behavior of a function. A function is continuous at a point if it doesn't have any breaks, jumps, or holes at that point. Let's delve into this concept with an example:

### Example:

Consider the function:

\[ f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \]

We'll examine the continuity of this function at \( x = 1 \).

### Continuity at a Point:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function is defined for all \( x \) except \( x = 1 \) because it leads to an indeterminate form (\( \frac{0}{0} \)).

2. **Simplifying the Function:**
   - As we did in the previous example, we simplify the function to \( f(x) = x + 1 \) after canceling out the common factor.

3. **Direct Substitution:**
   - If you substitute \( x = 1 \) into the simplified function, you get \( f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

### Conclusion:

Since \( f(x) \) is defined at \( x = 1 \) (after simplification), and the value of \( f(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) is equal to the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches 1, the function is continuous at \( x = 1 \).

### Additional Notes:

- A function can be continuous at a specific point, over an interval, or on its entire domain.
- There are three conditions for continuity:
  - The function is defined at the point.
  - The limit of the function at that point exists.
  - The value of the function equals the limit at that point.

In summary, continuity ensures the smoothness of a function, and it's assessed by examining the function's behavior at specific points. In the given example, the function \( f(x) = \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \) is continuous at \( x = 1 \).

Let's break down the concepts of functions and their graphs, range and domain, and elementary methods for finding limits, as well as discuss elementary tests for continuity and differentiability.

### Functions and Their Graphs:

- **Function Definition:** A function is a rule or a relation that assigns each input from a set (the domain) to exactly one output from another set (the codomain or range).
  
- **Graphs of Functions:** The graph of a function is a visual representation that shows how the output (dependent variable) changes with respect to the input (independent variable).

### Range and Domain:

- **Domain:** The set of all possible input values for which the function is defined.
  
- **Range:** The set of all possible output values that the function can produce.

### Elementary Methods of Finding Limits (Right and Left):

- **Right-hand Limit (\( \lim_{{x \to a^+}} f(x) \)):** The value the function approaches as \( x \) gets arbitrarily close to \( a \) from the right.
  
- **Left-hand Limit (\( \lim_{{x \to a^-}} f(x) \)):** The value the function approaches as \( x \) gets arbitrarily close to \( a \) from the left.

### Elementary Test for Continuity:

A function \( f(x) \) is continuous at a point \( c \) if:

1. \( f(c) \) is defined (the function is defined at \( c \)).
  
2. \( \lim_{{x \to c}} f(x) \) exists (the limit at \( c \) exists).

3. \( \lim_{{x \to c}} f(x) = f(c) \) (the limit equals the function value).

### Elementary Test for Differentiability:

A function \( f(x) \) is differentiable at a point \( c \) if:

1. \( f'(c) \) exists (the derivative at \( c \) exists).

2. \( f(x) \) is continuous at \( c \) (the function is continuous at \( c \)).

### Summary Example:

Let's consider the function \( f(x) = x^2 \):

- **Graph:** The graph is a parabola opening upwards.
  
- **Domain:** All real numbers (\( (-\infty, \infty) \)).
  
- **Range:** All real numbers greater than or equal to zero (\( [0, \infty) \)).

- **Right-hand Limit at 2:** \( \lim_{{x \to 2^+}} f(x) = 4 \).
  
- **Left-hand Limit at 2:** \( \lim_{{x \to 2^-}} f(x) = 4 \).

- **Continuity at \( x = 2 \):** The function is continuous at \( x = 2 \) as \( f(2) = 4 \) and both one-sided limits exist and are equal.

- **Differentiability at \( x = 2 \):** The function is differentiable at \( x = 2 \) as the derivative \( f'(x) = 2x \) exists everywhere, including \( x = 2 \).

Understanding these concepts and performing these tests is crucial for a deeper grasp of calculus and mathematical analysis.

There are several methods for finding derivatives, and the choice of method often depends on the complexity of the function. Here are some commonly used methods:

### 1. **Power Rule:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{(n-1)} \]

This rule is applicable when you have a term in the form \(x^n\).

### 2. **Sum Rule:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)] + \frac{d}{dx}[g(x)] \]

The derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their derivatives.

### 3. **Product Rule:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) \]

This rule helps find the derivative of a product of two functions.

### 4. **Quotient Rule:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \]

Used for finding the derivative of a quotient of two functions.

### 5. **Chain Rule:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \]

This rule is employed when you have a composition of functions.

### 6. **Trigonometric Functions:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x) \]
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x) \]
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x) \]

Derivatives of common trigonometric functions have specific rules.

### 7. **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x \]
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x} \]

Derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions also have specific rules.

### 8. **Implicit Differentiation:**
Used when the dependent variable is not explicitly expressed in terms of the independent variable.

### 9. **Logarithmic Differentiation:**
Taking the logarithm of both sides of an equation before differentiating can simplify complex expressions.

### 10. **Parametric Differentiation:**
Used when functions are given parametrically in terms of a third variable.

### 11. **Inverse Function Rule:**
\[ \frac{d}{dx}[f^{-1}(x)] = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))} \]

This rule applies when finding the derivative of an inverse function.

### 12. **Differential Rules:**
\[ dy = f'(x) \cdot dx \]

Differentials provide a way to approximate changes in the function.

Understanding and applying these rules will help you find derivatives for a wide variety of functions and expressions. It's crucial to practice these techniques to develop proficiency in differentiation.

Trigonometric functions are mathematical functions that relate the angles of a right triangle to the ratios of the sides. The most common trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, and tangent. Here are the main trigonometric functions and some of their properties:

### Sine Function (\( \sin(x) \)):

\[ \sin(x) = \frac{{\text{opposite side}}}{{\text{hypotenuse}}} \]

- **Domain:** All real numbers.
  
- **Range:** \([-1, 1]\).
  
- **Periodicity:** \(2\pi\) radians (or \(360^\circ\)).

### Cosine Function (\( \cos(x) \)):

\[ \cos(x) = \frac{{\text{adjacent side}}}{{\text{hypotenuse}}} \]

- **Domain:** All real numbers.
  
- **Range:** \([-1, 1]\).
  
- **Periodicity:** \(2\pi\) radians (or \(360^\circ\)).

### Tangent Function (\( \tan(x) \)):

\[ \tan(x) = \frac{{\sin(x)}}{{\cos(x)}} \]

- **Domain:** All real numbers except \(\frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\), where \(k\) is an integer.
  
- **Range:** All real numbers.
  
- **Periodicity:** \(\pi\) radians (or \(180^\circ\)).

### Other Trigonometric Functions:

- **Cosecant Function (\( \csc(x) \)):** \( \csc(x) = \frac{1}{{\sin(x)}} \)
  
- **Secant Function (\( \sec(x) \)):** \( \sec(x) = \frac{1}{{\cos(x)}} \)
  
- **Cotangent Function (\( \cot(x) \)):** \( \cot(x) = \frac{1}{{\tan(x)}} \)

### Trigonometric Identities:

- **Pythagorean Identity:** \( \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1 \)
  
- **Reciprocal Identity:** \( \csc(x) = \frac{1}{{\sin(x)}} \), \( \sec(x) = \frac{1}{{\cos(x)}} \), \( \cot(x) = \frac{1}{{\tan(x)}} \)
  
- **Quotient Identity:** \( \tan(x) = \frac{{\sin(x)}}{{\cos(x)}} \)

### Graphs of Trigonometric Functions:

- The sine and cosine functions have a periodic waveform that oscillates between \(-1\) and \(1\).
  
- The tangent function has asymptotes at odd multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
  
- The cosecant, secant, and cotangent functions have similar periodic behavior.

### Trigonometric Function Derivatives:

- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x) \)
  
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)] = -\sin(x) \)
  
- \( \frac{d}{dx}[\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x) \)

Understanding trigonometric functions is essential in various mathematical and scientific applications, especially in calculus, physics, and engineering. The periodic nature of these functions and their relationships play a crucial role in modeling periodic phenomena.

The exponential function is a mathematical function of the form \(f(x) = a^x\), where \(a\) is a positive constant and \(x\) is the variable. The base \(a\) is typically a positive number not equal to 1, and the exponent \(x\) can be any real number.

### Key Properties of the Exponential Function:

1. **Growth or Decay:**
   - If \(a > 1\), the function represents exponential growth.
   - If \(0 < a < 1\), the function represents exponential decay.

2. **Special Case (\(e^x\)):**
   - The base \(e\) is a special mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.
   - The function \(f(x) = e^x\) is called the natural exponential function.

3. **Derivative of \(e^x\):**
   - \( \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x \)

4. **Inverse Function (\(\ln(x)\)):**
   - The natural logarithm function, denoted as \(\ln(x)\), is the inverse of the natural exponential function.
   - \( \ln(e^x) = x \) and \(e^{\ln(x)} = x\).

5. **Exponential Growth and Decay Formula:**
   - For exponential growth: \(A(t) = A_0 \cdot e^{kt}\), where \(A_0\) is the initial amount and \(k\) is the growth rate.
   - For exponential decay: \(A(t) = A_0 \cdot e^{-kt}\), where \(A_0\) is the initial amount and \(k\) is the decay rate.

### Graph of \(e^x\):

- The graph of \(y = e^x\) is always increasing and passes through the point \((0, 1)\).

- As \(x\) approaches negative infinity, \(e^x\) approaches 0.
  
- As \(x\) approaches positive infinity, \(e^x\) increases without bound.

### Applications:

1. **Compound Interest:**
   - The compound interest formula involves exponential growth.

2. **Population Growth:**
   - Exponential functions model population growth when the growth rate is proportional to the current population.

3. **Radioactive Decay:**
   - The decay of radioactive substances follows an exponential decay model.

4. **Physics and Engineering:**
   - Exponential functions are prevalent in areas such as signal processing, electrical circuits, and fluid dynamics.

### Exponential Function Derivatives:

1. \( \frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^x \cdot \ln(a) \)
  
2. \( \frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x \)

Understanding the exponential function is crucial in various scientific and mathematical disciplines, especially in calculus, finance, and the natural sciences. It describes processes that exhibit exponential growth or decay over time.

The concept of a function of a function, often referred to as a composite function, involves combining two functions to create a new function. Let's explore this concept with an example.

### Example:

Consider two functions:
1. \( f(x) = x^2 \)
2. \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \)

Now, let's create a new function \( h(x) \) which is the composition of \( f \) and \( g \), denoted as \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \).

### Steps to Find \( h(x) \):

1. **Start with the Inner Function:**
   - Substitute \( g(x) \) into \( f(x) \):
     \[ h(x) = f(g(x)) = f(\sqrt{x}) \]

2. **Apply the Outer Function:**
   - Substitute \( \sqrt{x} \) into \( f(x) \):
     \[ h(x) = (\sqrt{x})^2 \]

3. **Simplify:**
   - Combine terms:
     \[ h(x) = x \]

### Interpretation:

In this example, \( h(x) \) is a function of \( x \) that results from first applying \( g(x) = \sqrt{x} \) and then applying \( f(x) = x^2 \). The composition \( h(x) = x \) indicates that the two functions, when composed, essentially cancel each other out.

### Notation:

The notation for a composite function is denoted as \( (f \circ g)(x) \) or \( f(g(x)) \), where \( f \) is the outer function, and \( g \) is the inner function.

### General Form:

For two functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), the composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \) is formed by taking the output of \( g(x) \) and using it as the input for \( f(x) \).

### Application:

Composite functions are widely used in various areas, including physics, engineering, and computer science. For instance, in physics, a displacement function might be a composition of functions representing velocity and time.

### Derivative of a Composite Function:

The Chain Rule is used to find the derivative of a composite function. If \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \), then:
\[ h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \]

Understanding function composition is crucial in analyzing complex relationships and modeling real-world phenomena using mathematical functions.

Logarithmic differentiation is a technique used in calculus to simplify the differentiation of functions that involve products, quotients, or powers. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of an equation, you can often make the differentiation process more manageable. Here's an overview of the steps involved in logarithmic differentiation:

### Steps for Logarithmic Differentiation:

1. **Start with the Function:**
   - Begin with a given function that involves multiplication, division, or powers. For example, consider \( y = x^x \cdot e^{\sin(x)} \).

2. **Take the Natural Logarithm:**
   - Apply the natural logarithm (\( \ln \)) to both sides of the equation:
     \[ \ln(y) = \ln\left(x^x \cdot e^{\sin(x)}\right) \]

3. **Use Logarithm Properties:**
   - Utilize logarithm properties to simplify the expression. For example, \(\ln(ab) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)\) and \(\ln(e^x) = x\).
     \[ \ln(y) = \ln(x^x) + \ln(e^{\sin(x)}) \]

4. **Apply Power Rule and Chain Rule:**
   - Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\) using the chain rule and the fact that \( \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(u)) = \frac{1}{u} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} \):
     \[ \frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(x^x) + \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \(y'\):**
   - Simplify the expression and solve for \(y'\), the derivative of \(y\):
     \[ y' = y \left(\frac{d}{dx}(x^x) + \cos(x)\right) \]

### Benefits of Logarithmic Differentiation:

- **Simplifies Complicated Functions:** Logarithmic differentiation is particularly useful when dealing with functions that involve products, quotients, or powers, making the differentiation process more straightforward.

- **Handles Products and Quotients:** By using logarithms, products become sums, and quotients become differences, which can be easier to differentiate.

- **Avoids Messy Algebra:** In some cases, the logarithmic approach can avoid complex algebraic manipulations that may arise when dealing directly with the original function.

### Example:

Consider the function \(y = x^x \cdot e^{\sin(x)}\). By applying logarithmic differentiation, you can simplify the differentiation process and find the derivative more easily.

\[ \ln(y) = x \ln(x) + \sin(x) \]

Differentiate both sides with respect to \(x\):

\[ \frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = \ln(x) + 1 + \cos(x) \]

Solve for \(y'\):

\[ y' = y \left(\ln(x) + 1 + \cos(x)\right) \]

This is the derivative of the original function obtained through logarithmic differentiation.

Logarithmic differentiation is a powerful technique that can be particularly helpful when dealing with complex functions, and it's often used to simplify the process of finding derivatives.

The differentiation of inverse trigonometric functions involves finding the derivatives of functions like \(\arcsin(x)\), \(\arccos(x)\), and \(\arctan(x)\), among others. Here are the derivatives of some common inverse trigonometric functions:

### 1. Derivative of \(\arcsin(x)\):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\arcsin(x)] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]

This derivative can be derived using the fact that \(\sin(\arcsin(x)) = x\) and applying the chain rule.

### 2. Derivative of \(\arccos(x)\):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\arccos(x)] = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]

Similar to \(\arcsin(x)\), this can be obtained using the relationship \(\cos(\arccos(x)) = x\) and the chain rule.

### 3. Derivative of \(\arctan(x)\):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\arctan(x)] = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \]

This result can be derived by using the fact that \(\tan(\arctan(x)) = x\) and applying the chain rule.

### 4. Derivative of \(\text{arccot}(x)\):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\text{arccot}(x)] = -\frac{1}{1 + x^2} \]

Similar to \(\arctan(x)\), this can be obtained using the relationship \(\cot(\text{arccot}(x)) = x\) and the chain rule.

### 5. Derivative of \(\text{arcsec}(x)\):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\text{arcsec}(x)] = \frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \]

This derivative can be derived using the identity \(\sec(\text{arcsec}(x)) = x\) and the chain rule.

### 6. Derivative of \(\text{arccsc}(x)\):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}[\text{arccsc}(x)] = -\frac{1}{|x|\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \]

Similar to \(\text{arcsec}(x)\), this can be obtained using the relationship \(\csc(\text{arccsc}(x)) = x\) and the chain rule.

### Key Points:

- The derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions involve the reciprocal of the square root of a certain expression.
- The domain of these functions is restricted to ensure the expression inside the square root is valid.

These derivatives are useful in various calculus applications, especially when dealing with problems involving angles or trigonometric functions. It's essential to understand these derivatives and their applications in both calculus and physics.

Implicit differentiation is a technique used when an equation defines a relationship between two variables, and one variable is a function of the other, but the equation is not explicitly solved for the dependent variable. In other words, the equation is in an implicit form.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in implicit differentiation:

### Steps for Implicit Differentiation:

1. **Start with the Implicit Equation:**
   - Begin with an equation that relates \(x\) and \(y\) implicitly. For example, consider \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).

2. **Differentiate Both Sides with Respect to \(x\):**
   - Apply the derivative to both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\). Treat \(y\) as a function of \(x\), and use the chain rule when differentiating \(y\).
     \[ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(1) \]

3. **Apply the Chain Rule:**
   - When differentiating \(y^2\), use the chain rule:
     \[ 2y \frac{dy}{dx} \]

4. **Solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) (the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\)):
     \[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y} \]

### Example:

Consider the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). Apply implicit differentiation:

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(1) \]

\[ 2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \]

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y} \]

### Key Points:

- **Chain Rule:** Implicit differentiation involves applying the chain rule to terms containing \(y\).
  
- **Product Rule:** If there are products involving \(x\) and \(y\) terms, the product rule is also applied.

- **Solving for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\):** The goal is often to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\).

### Application:

Implicit differentiation is often used when explicit solutions for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) are difficult to find. It is commonly employed in problems involving curves, tangents, and rates of change.

### Example Problem:

Consider the ellipse equation \(x^2 + 2y^2 = 4\). Use implicit differentiation to find the slope of the tangent line at a specific point.

\[ \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 2y^2) = \frac{d}{dx}(4) \]

Solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) and substitute the coordinates of the given point to find the slope of the tangent line at that point.
