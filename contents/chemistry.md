## Atomic Structure & Chemical Bonding

**Atomic structure**
Atomic structure refers to the organization and arrangement of subatomic particles within an atom. Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter and consist of three main subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons.

1. **Protons:** Positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number, and it determines the element to which the atom belongs.

2. **Neutrons:** Neutral particles are found in the nucleus along with protons. They have a mass similar to protons but carry no electric charge.

3. **Electrons:** Negatively charged particles that orbit the nucleus in electron shells or energy levels. Electrons are much smaller and lighter than protons and neutrons.

The nucleus, composed of protons and neutrons, is at the center of the atom and contains most of its mass. Electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels, which are sometimes referred to as electron shells.

The key points about atomic structure include:

- **Atomic Number (Z):** The number of protons in an atom, which determines the element. Elements are arranged in the periodic table based on their atomic number.

- **Mass Number (A):** The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom. It is denoted by the symbol A.

- **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes have the same atomic number but different mass numbers.

- **Electron Shells:** Regions around the nucleus where electrons are likely to be found. Electrons fill the inner shells first before occupying the outer shells.

- **Valence Electrons:** Electrons in the outermost shell of an atom, which are involved in chemical reactions.

- **Atomic Mass:** The average mass of an atom of an element, taking into account the abundance of its isotopes. It is often expressed in atomic mass units (AMU).

Understanding atomic structure is crucial for explaining the properties and behavior of matter, as well as for predicting the chemical behavior of elements and their interactions in compounds.


**Chemical bonding**
Chemical bonding is the process by which atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. Atoms bond together to achieve a more stable and lower energy state. There are three main types of chemical bonds: ionic, covalent, and metallic.

1. **Ionic Bonding:**
   - **Description:** Ionic bonding occurs when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, resulting in the formation of ions.
   - **Formation:** Typically involves a metal (which loses electrons to become a positively charged ion or cation) and a non-metal (which gains electrons to become a negatively charged ion or anion).
   - **Example:** Sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) combine to form sodium chloride (NaCl), where sodium donates an electron to chlorine.

2. **Covalent Bonding:**
   - **Description:** Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electrons between atoms to achieve a more stable electron configuration.
   - **Formation:** Generally occurs between non-metal atoms.
   - **Example:** In a molecule of hydrogen (H2), two hydrogen atoms share electrons to achieve a stable configuration.

3. **Metallic Bonding:**
   - **Description:** Metallic bonding occurs between metal atoms and involves the sharing of electrons in a "sea" of electrons that are free to move.
   - **Formation:** Common in metals, where electrons are delocalized and not associated with any particular atom.
   - **Example:** In a metal like copper (Cu), the outer electrons are shared among many atoms, forming a metallic bond.

These types of bonding can also coexist in certain substances, leading to a range of properties. For example, there are substances with both ionic and covalent character, known as polar covalent compounds.

Other important concepts related to chemical bonding include:

- **Polar and Nonpolar Bonds:** In a polar covalent bond, electrons are shared unevenly, leading to a partial charge separation. In a nonpolar covalent bond, electrons are shared equally.

- **Lewis Structures:** Diagrams that represent the valence electrons of atoms and the sharing or transfer of electrons in a molecule.

- **Electronegativity:** A measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond. The electronegativity difference between atoms helps determine the type of bond formed (ionic or covalent).

- **Resonance:** Some molecules can be represented by multiple Lewis structures, and the actual structure is an average or combination of these resonance structures.

Understanding chemical bonding is fundamental to understanding the behavior of matter and is crucial in fields such as chemistry and material science.


## Fuel & Lubricants
**Fuel:**
A fuel is a substance that undergoes combustion or reacts with another substance to release energy. It is commonly used to generate heat or power, and it can take various forms, including solid, liquid, or gas.

**Types of Fuels:**

The choice of fuel depends on factors such as the application, infrastructure, and environmental considerations. For example, gaseous fuels are often preferred for heating and electricity generation, while liquid fuels are commonly used in transportation. Solid fuels are frequently used for heating and cooking, especially in regions with abundant biomass resources.

**Lubricants**
Lubricants are substances that reduce friction between moving surfaces by providing a slippery film. They are used to minimize wear and tear, dissipate heat, and prevent corrosion in mechanical systems. Lubricants come in various forms, including liquids, greases, and solid lubricants.

**Properties of Lubricants:**
1. **Viscosity:** The thickness or resistance to flow of the lubricant.
2. **Film Strength:** Ability to maintain a protective film between moving parts.
3. **Temperature Stability:** Performance across a range of temperatures.
4. **Chemical Stability:** Resistance to degradation in the presence of contaminants or under varying conditions.
5. **Additives:** Additional substances added to enhance specific properties, such as anti-wear agents, corrosion inhibitors, and antioxidants.

**Mechanism of Lubrication:**
There are three primary mechanisms of lubrication:
1. **Boundary Lubrication:** Thin layers of lubricant separate the moving surfaces.
2. **Hydrodynamic Lubrication:** Lubricant forms a continuous film that separates the surfaces due to fluid pressure.
3. **Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL):** Lubricant film formed under high pressure between conforming surfaces.

**Industrial Applications:**
Lubricants find extensive use in various industries, including:
1. **Automotive Industry:** Engine oils, transmission fluids, and greases are used to reduce friction and protect components.
2. **Manufacturing:** Lubricants are vital in metalworking, machining, and assembly processes.
3. **Aerospace:** Used in aircraft engines, landing gear, and various mechanical components.
4. **Energy Sector:** Lubricants play a crucial role in power generation, especially in turbines and gear systems.

**Function in Bearings:**
Bearings are mechanical components used to support and guide rotating or oscillating shafts. Lubricants in bearings serve several functions:
1. **Reducing Friction:** Lubricants minimize friction between the rolling or sliding elements in a bearing, preventing wear and overheating.
2. **Heat Dissipation:** Lubricants absorb and dissipate heat generated during operation, preventing the bearing from overheating.
3. **Preventing Corrosion:** Lubricants protect bearing surfaces from corrosion by forming a barrier against moisture and contaminants.
4. **Extending Component Life:** Proper lubrication helps prolong the life of bearings and reduces the frequency of maintenance.

In bearings, the choice of lubricant depends on factors such as operating conditions, load, speed, and temperature. Common lubricants include oils, greases, and solid lubricants, each suited to specific applications and environmental conditions. Regular maintenance, including lubricant monitoring and replacement, is crucial to ensure optimal bearing performance and longevity.

## Corrosion and its control
**Corrosion:**
Corrosion is the deterioration of a material, usually a metal, as a result of chemical reactions with the environment. The most common form of corrosion involves the reaction of metals with oxygen and moisture to form metal oxides or other compounds. Corrosion can lead to a loss of material, weakened structural integrity, and reduced functionality of the affected components.

**Factors Influencing Corrosion:**
1. **Presence of Moisture:** Water or humidity is often a key factor in corrosion reactions.
2. **Oxygen:** The availability of oxygen in the environment accelerates the corrosion process.
3. **Metal Type:** Different metals have varying susceptibility to corrosion. Some metals are more corrosion-resistant than others.
4. **Temperature:** Corrosion reactions often occur more rapidly at higher temperatures.
5. **pH Levels:** The acidity or alkalinity of the environment can influence corrosion rates.
6. **Impurities:** Presence of impurities or contaminants in the environment can enhance corrosion.

**Types of Corrosion:**
1. **Uniform Corrosion:** General corrosion over the entire surface of the material.
2. **Galvanic Corrosion:** Occurs when two dissimilar metals are in electrical contact in the presence of an electrolyte.
3. **Pitting Corrosion:** Localized corrosion that leads to the formation of small pits or craters on the material surface.
4. **Crevice Corrosion:** Occurs in confined spaces or crevices, where the lack of proper ventilation accelerates corrosion.
5. **Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC):** The combined effect of stress and corrosion, leading to cracking of the material.

**Corrosion Control:**
Several methods are employed to control or prevent corrosion:

1. **Protective Coatings:**
   - Applying coatings like paints, varnishes, or metallic coatings creates a barrier between the metal and the corrosive environment.

2. **Cathodic Protection:**
   - Placing a more reactive metal (sacrificial anode) in contact with the metal to be protected can act as a sacrificial element, corroding instead of the protected metal.

3. **Anodic Protection:**
   - Applying an external electric current to maintain the metal at an anodic potential, preventing corrosion.

4. **Corrosion Inhibitors:**
   - Adding chemicals to the environment or applying them directly to the metal surface can inhibit the corrosion process.

5. **Proper Design and Material Selection:**
   - Choosing corrosion-resistant materials and designing structures to minimize crevices and moisture traps can prevent corrosion.

6. **Control of Environmental Conditions:**
   - Regulating temperature, humidity, and the chemical composition of the environment can help control corrosion.

7. **Regular Maintenance and Inspection:**
   - Monitoring and timely maintenance of structures or equipment can help identify and address corrosion issues before they become severe.

Corrosion control measures are often implemented in combination, depending on the specific application and environmental conditions. A comprehensive corrosion protection plan is essential to ensure the longevity and reliability of structures and equipment.
